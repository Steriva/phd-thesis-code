In this directory, you will find Jupyter notebooks that implement most of the results from the PhD Thesis divided into the chapter of the thesis itself. Here's a brief overview of the contents:

- **Chapter 2** (*Reduced Order Modelling Methods*): introductory chapter on basics of reduced order modelling methods.
- **Chapter 3** (*Direct State Estimation*): estimation of observable fields from boundary, out-core and failed sensors.
- **Chapter 4** (*State Estimation of Unobservable Fields*): inverse problems for parameter estimation and estimation of unobservable fields, from boundary and out-core sensors.
- **Chapter 5** (*Model Bias Correction in Nuclear Reactors*): model bias correction in nuclear reactors using DDROM appoaches for nuclear benchmark-derived problems.
- **Chapter 6** (*The Theory Behind Shallow Recurrent Decoders*): theory behind shallow recurrent decoders and their application to state estimation on a simple Flow over cylinder.
- **Chapter 7** (*Shallow Recurrent Decoders for State Estimation*): application of SHRED to nuclear reactors.
- **Appendix A** (*Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition*): parametric dynamic mode decomposition for model discovery.
